[Optimizing Nursing Home Distribution and Quality Using Medicare/Medicaid Enrollment and Population Trends](/nursing_home_project)

This project was completed as part of a graduate-level technical report in health informatics. The objective was to evaluate and improve the distribution and quality of nursing homes across the United States using publicly available healthcare and demographic data.

We sourced our data from CMSâ€™s Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse and the Medicare Monthly Enrollment datasets. The analysis integrated geographic, enrollment, and quality rating data to identify underserved areas, evaluate staffing and quality measures, and propose strategies for improving long-term care.

**Key questions we explored:**
- Does region (Midwest, South, East, and West) correlate with higher rates of Medicare/Medicaid enrollment and the distribution of nursing homes?
- What quality measures do nursing homes perform well in, and where is there room for improvement?
- Which states have a higher older population (65+) where more nursing homes would be beneficial?

**What we did:**
- Conducted correlation and geographic trend analysis by U.S. region  
- Filtered and cleaned large datasets to focus on metrics like staffing, certified beds, and quality measures  
- Built visualizations to highlight discrepancies in access and performance  
- Evaluated areas for potential new nursing home development based on need and population trends

This work aims to support healthcare administrators, policymakers, and community planners in making data-driven decisions to ensure better long-term care access and equity.
